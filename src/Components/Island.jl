# Island.jl - Interactive island components that compile to WASM
#
# Islands are the boundary between static SSR and interactive client code.
# Like Leptos #[island], marking a component as an island means:
# - It will be compiled to WebAssembly
# - It will hydrate on the client
# - Its signals and event handlers become interactive

Define an interactive island component that compiles to WASM.

Islands are the interactive parts of your app. Everything else is static HTML.
This follows the Leptos islands pattern - static by default, opt-in to interactivity.

# Examples
```julia
# Define an interactive counter
Counter = island(:Counter) do
    count, set_count = create_signal(0)

    Div(:class => "flex gap-4",
        Button(:on_click => () -> set_count(count() - 1), "-"),
        Span(count),
        Button(:on_click => () -> set_count(count() + 1), "+")
    )
end

# Use it in a route (auto-wrapped in <therapy-island>)
function Index()
    Layout(
        H1("My App"),
        Counter()  # Renders as interactive island
    )
end
```
"""
function island(render_fn::Function, name::Symbol)
    def = IslandDef(name, render_fn)
    ISLAND_REGISTRY[name] = def
    return def
end

# Support island(:Name) do ... end syntax
island(name::Symbol) = render_fn -> island(render_fn, name)

"""
Make IslandDef callable - returns an IslandVNode for rendering.
Uses invokelatest to handle dynamically loaded islands.
"""
function (def::IslandDef)()
    content = Base.invokelatest(def.render_fn)
    return IslandVNode(def.name, content)
end

"""
Get all registered islands.
"""
get_islands() = values(ISLAND_REGISTRY)

"""
Get island by name.
"""
get_island(name::Symbol) = get(ISLAND_REGISTRY, name, nothing)

"""
Clear island registry (useful for reloading in dev mode).
"""
clear_islands!() = empty!(ISLAND_REGISTRY)

"""
Check if a name is a registered island.
"""
is_island(name::Symbol) = haskey(ISLAND_REGISTRY, name)
