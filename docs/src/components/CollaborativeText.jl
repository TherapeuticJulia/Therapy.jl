Collaborative text editor demonstrating bidirectional signals.

This is NOT an island (no Wasm needed) - it's a static component
that syncs via WebSocket. The `data-bidirectional-signal` attribute
tells the WebSocket client to:
1. Update this element when server broadcasts changes
2. Send changes to server when user types

In static mode (GitHub Pages), the warning will show that
collaborative features are unavailable.
