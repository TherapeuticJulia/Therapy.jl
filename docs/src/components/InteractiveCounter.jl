# InteractiveCounter.jl - A Therapy.jl component compiled to WebAssembly
#
# This is a real Therapy.jl reactive component that gets compiled to Wasm.
# The Julia code here IS the source of truth - no hand-written JS/Wasm.
#
# How it works:
#   1. create_signal(0) creates reactive state
#   2. :on_click handlers reference the signal
#   3. compile_component() analyzes this and generates Wasm bytecode
#   4. The Wasm handles all increment/decrement/DOM-update logic

"""
Interactive counter component - compiled to WebAssembly.

This demonstrates Therapy.jl's Leptos-style reactivity:
- State lives in signals (compiled to Wasm globals)
- Event handlers are Julia closures (compiled to Wasm functions)
- DOM updates happen automatically when signals change
